<br/>
I am a musician and audio programmer originally from Duluth, Minnesota. I went to school and worked in the
game industry for several years in Chicago, IL before becoming a software engineer at Universal Audio in
Boulder, CO.

Professionally, I have designed and maintained game engines in C++ and Typescript and I currently help maintain
Universal Audio's UAD audio plugin platform.

As a musician I have toured around the Midwest and released several records over the years, which can be
found on my Bandcamp below.

So now we have line level audio out!
You could plug this into your audio interface or powered speakers at this point
What if you want to plug in headphones?
Last step, I promise

This is where amplifiers come in
Youâ€™ve got your analog signal, but its too quiet to listen on regular old speakers, like this chonky one or your headphones

A few weeks ago, I gave a short talk for the Sound Recording Technology majors at DePaul University (the program where I got my 
degree) which gave an overview of the world of audio programming. I had wanted to do this for some time because audio programming
is a fairly niche field, to the point that a lot of capable audio engineers and musicians miss out on careers and opportunities that
they might totally love if they only knew it was a possibility. This post comes from that mini-talk and is meant to be just another
voice to consider for any musically inclined folks who are looking to apply their passion for music in a way that might be less obvious.

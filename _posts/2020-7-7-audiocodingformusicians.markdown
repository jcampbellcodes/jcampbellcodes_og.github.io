# What is audio programming?
<br>

A few weeks ago, I gave a short talk for the Sound Recording Technology program at DePaul University (the program where I got my 
degree) which gave an overview of the world of audio programming. I had wanted to do this for some time because audio programming
is a fairly niche field, to the point that a lot of capable audio engineers and musicians miss out on careers and opportunities that
they might totally love if they only knew about the possibilities. This post comes from that mini-talk and is meant to be just another
voice to consider for any musically inclined folks who are looking to apply their passion for music in a way that might be less obvious.

Audio programming is a great way to combine the passions for music and technology. Even though the field is niche, it is still vast and widely
varied. Audio programming skills are needed to design audio effects plugins, music notation software, spatialized audio simulations in video games, noise reduction in conference call software, audio engines for digital pianos, audio implementation for the interior of a high-end car -- any piece of audio 
gear or software that you love was probably designed and written by some other audio nerd. 

While there are many ways to categorize the various disciplines within audio software, I tend to split up the specialties based on the skills
required to get many specific jobs. These three areas -- applications, systems, and DSP -- tend to overlap *significantly*, though they are distinct
in the skills required and day-to-day work that would be involved if you got a job with one of them in the title. (Though of course, an Audio Systems Engineer
probably knows some DSP, and an Audio DSP Engineer probably knows their low-level audio APIs to an extent, for instance.)

# Why get into audio programming?
<br>


Many audio-technology-inclined students don't realize that this is a path they could  pursue because software development has a reputation 
for being a complicated and grueling field with a sharp startup cost. The reason I'm making this post is to let you know that should not 
stop you from checking it out. Becoming an expert is hard, sure (I'm definitely not even close to that yet), but learning how to program 
and make cool audio stuff has never been easier or more accessible.

There are boring but practical considerations for choosing to pursue audio software development as a musically inclined individual. Unlike
many music careers like performance, sound engineering, or lesson teaching, audio software developers get many of the ubiquitous perks that all
software engineers enjoy: full-time, salaried work, with benefits. And if you are willing to move, you will always be able to find a job.
Some people are totally allergic to the whole "9-5 office job" thing, and maybe that's why they got into music in the first place. Audio tech
jobs are not going to be like that; there is a lot less glory, and for some, less satisfaction than playing or producing music. But if you are
driven by the quiet satisfaction of making things beep and boop, this may be the field for you.

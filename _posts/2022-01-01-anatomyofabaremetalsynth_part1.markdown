There's something magic about building music devices. Hacking away at a digital synthesizer or
guitar pedal built with your own two hands and pumping out some weird sounds can be a 
rewarding project. But where do you start?

From the outside, embedded software development can seem intimidating. Even for professional
software developers in other disciplines, there is a ton of new foreign jargon, additional
concerns to take into account, and a sometimes hostile development environment compared
to a cozy and powerful native system.

The good news is that, while embedded development is indeed a deep rabbit hole, the learning
curve is more manageable than it appears. This series of articles is meant to expose-via-example 
some of the jargon and direction to latch on to when building embedded music devices. We will be
using a bare metal synth written in C++ using the [Electrosmith Daisy](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples) platform to go over some 
of the key concepts and subsystems you might see in a music project. 

### Prerequisites / Additional Reading
<br>

My hope is that these articles can serve as a starting point for some,
but be specific enough to be practical. That said, these articles may assume some existing programming background, and some experience with analog electronics could be helpful as well. A book I highly recommend for getting a start with electronics in general (analog and some digital) is Charles Platt's 
[Make: Electronics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/make-electronics/9781449377267/).

That book goes over the equipment and components that you'll want in your lab, basic principles of 
electricity and circuit patterns, cool labs, soldering, and it happens to have a few neat audio projects in it as well.

For instance, you'll learn how to go from a circuit diagram like this one from this great [LM386 amplifier tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/Tales-From-the-Chip-LM386-Audio-Amplifier/):

To the corresponding prototype implementation of this circuit, using a tool known as a [solderless breadboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard). These boards allow you to try out circuit design prototypes by plugging throughhole components
into holes before committing to a design by soldering it together.

### What is "bare metal"?
<br>

One thing to be aware of when diving into embedded development is that there are a number of
subcategories under that umbrella that may bring unnecessary confusion during a Google search. 
The following articles will be discussing "bare metal" C++ development, but I'd like to briefly discuss a few 
of these other subcategories to give some context. They all share common elements, but differ enough 
that it is good to know (for instance) whether advice you find for one type will apply to your current 
efforts.


# Bare metal development
<br>

"Bare metal" is sometimes a contested term, but I use it simply to mean development
for a microcontroller with no operating system. When developing for a bare metal system, you usually 
have a library specific to the board (or family of boards) that you are developing for, which
defines hardware registers that you read from or write to directly, rather than passing through an 
interface provided by an OS. You often are writing
drivers yourself (or are using vendor provided ones, that you could modify if desired) and don't 
need to go through an OS to perform the lowest level operations. Elecia White's [Making Embedded Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-embedded-systems/9781449308889/) is a great introduction to bare metal programming, with concepts that will also aid when getting into other 
types of embedded development.

While there are less guardrails in bare metal development, it also is a less distracting way to learn about embedded programming compared to the following approach.

# Embedded Linux development
<br>

The other extreme for programming microcontrollers, opposite bare metal programming, is embedded Linux development. This entails
building a custom Linux distribution that works with your target hardware that includes your
application software. When starting from scratch, embedded Linux can be much more complicated than bare-metal,
due to the complexity of rolling your own Linux distro (either manually, or more likely via a 
build system such as Yocto or Buildroot). There is also the potentially significant extra runtime overhead of running an OS on your target and development overhead of getting around the OS to 
perform low level operations. However, embedded Linux can be a powerful way to develop and is
the go-to approach for writing or porting cross platform software that can more easily be deployed to 
native platforms like macOS or Windows (or even native Linux). Sometimes the ability to leverage
an OS outweighs the runtime cost, especially if your application requires you to reimplement
many of the features that Linux would have offered anyway.


# RTOS-based Development
<br>

Between the extremes of "bare metal" and "OS-based" embedded programming is programming using
an RTOS ("ar-toss"), a Real-Time Operating System, the most common of which you'll likely come
across being FreeRTOS. These operating systems exist with a range of features, but their core featue 
is a real-time scheduler. A bare metal application can integrate the features of an RTOS
but still, for the most part, "feel" like a baremetal application, which is why I place it 
somewhere in the middle. For instance, you may write all your I2C or SPI drivers to communicate 
with peripherals, and then leverage FreeRTOS scheduler for the realtime functionality of your 
application.

# FPGA Programming
<br>

The last type I'd like to mention is FPGA (field-programmable gate array) programming. This is
a different beast than the types of development listed above, which focus on programming a 
microcontroller with a higher level programming language like C++ or Python. When designing
an FPGA, you use an HDL (hardware description language) to directly configure the digital logic
gates on the device. FPGAs can be used to great effect in performance critical parts of a device.

### Anatomy of a Bare Metal Synth
<br>

So with the above context in mind, the next few posts are going to look at a bare metal
synth using the [Electrosmith Daisy](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples) 
platform, on the [STM32-based Daisy Seed](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy). This platform 
offers, in addition to the STM32 vendor-provided libraries, a 
suite of music-geared drivers and DSP modules that make developing embedded music
devices a lot more straightforward. I like it as a learning tool especially, since their
libraries are transparent and make it simpler to tinker with what is happening under the 
hood.

Other similar platforms you may find for starting bare metal development are the Arduino
and Teensy platforms. These are both more general purpose and will involve finding libraries
and peripherals in order to create audio devices, whereas the Daisy is music-geared out of the
box, with features like an on-board audio codec and USB MIDI support. However, Daisy still allows
us to look at how usual bare metal techniques work, like pin multiplexing and gpios, communication protocols, etc, so it strikes a nice balance for these articles.

This is a signal flow diagram of the components we will go over.

Specifically:
- MIDI data comes in from some generator or MIDI controller
- MIDI data goes through a MIDI isolator circuit
- Isolated MIDI is sent to the UART Rx pin on the Daisy
- The UART driver on the Daisy makes the MIDI data available to your application
- Your application interpets this MIDI and generates digital audio data in response
- That digital audio is sent to the STM32's SAI (serial audio interface) as an I2S signal
- The SAI sends that I2S signal to an audio codec (D/A converter) to create analog audio
- That analog audio is optionally amplified before being sent to a speaker or line out

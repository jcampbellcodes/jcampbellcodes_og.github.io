# <center> bio </center> 
<br>
Hailing from the icy northern Minnesota port town of Duluth, indie songwriter
Jack Campbell has spent much of the last ten years warming up inside with
a guitar and a tape machine. In keeping with the Midwestern approach to life,
many of the difficult subjects explored in his songs are hidden behind a smirking
pop facade.

Campbell's music has found a worldwide audience following the release of 
Absentee (2013), with much of his fanbase spread throughout the UK, Germany,
and the Netherlands. His latest release is the EP Lucky Break (2019), recorded
with Brett Bullion in Minneapolis, MN.

"Something tells me there's a bright future ahead for Jack Campbell."
- Andrea Swensson, NPR

<br>
Indie songwriter Jack Campbell's latest release, Lucky Break (2019), comes off the heels of finding his new
home base on the Colorado Front Range, where he moved to build audio effects and guitar pedals
by day and play his tunes at dives by night.

Originally hailing from the icy northern Minnesota port town of Duluth, Jack
has spent much of the last decade warming up inside with
a guitar and a tape recorder. In keeping with the Midwestern approach to life,
many of the difficult subjects explored in his songs are hidden behind a smirking
pop facade.

Campbell's music has found a worldwide audience following the release of 
Absentee (2013), with much of his fanbase spread throughout the UK, Germany,
and the Netherlands. 

"Something tells me there's a bright future ahead for Jack Campbell."
- Andrea Swensson, MPR (Minnesota Public Radio)
